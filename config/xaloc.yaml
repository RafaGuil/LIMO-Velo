/limovelo:
  ros__parameters:
    real_time: true         # in a slow CPU, real_time ensures to always output to latest odometry (possibly skipping points)
    print_debug: true

    # Topics
    points_topic: "/velodyne_points"
    imus_topic: "/vectornav/IMU"

    # Publishers
    high_quality_publish: true   # true: Publishes the map without downsampling, can be slower. false: Publishes the downsampled map.  

    # Extrinsics
    estimate_extrinsics: true
    print_extrinsics: false
    initial_gravity: [0.0, 0.0, +9.807]
    # Extrinsics LiDAR -> IMU
    I_Translation_L: [1.25, 0.0, 0.0]
    I_Rotation_L: [
        1.0,  0.0,  0.0,
        0.0, -1.0,  0.0,
        0.0,  0.0, -1.0
    ]

    # Delays
    time_without_clear_BUFFER_L: 0.1                  # Should be at least [FULL_ROTATION_TIME]
    time_without_clear_buffer_mapped_points: 0.1     # Should be at least [FULL_ROTATION_TIME]
    real_time_delay: 0.1                              # Should be at least [FULL_ROTATION_TIME] (without a modificated LiDAR driver)

    # LiDAR
    LiDAR_type: velodyne           # Options: velodyne, hesai, ouster, rslidar
    pub_full_pcl: true          # Publish the full pointcloud (true) or only the points used for the odometry (false)
    stamp_beginning: false      # (Usually: false) Is the pointcloud's stamp the last point's timestamp (end of rotation) or the first's (beggining of rotation)?
    offset_beginning: true     # (Usual values: Velodyne = false, Ouster = true, HESAI = indiferent) Is the offset with respect the beginning of the rotation (i.e. point.time ~ [0, 0.1]) or with respect the end (i.e. point.time ~ [-0.1, 0])?

    LiDAR_noise: 0.001
    full_rotation_time: 0.1
    min_dist: 1.0              # Minimum distance: doesn't use points closer than this radius

    # Mapping
    mapping: true     # set to 'true' until mapping offline fixed (see Discussions in GitHub)
    downsample_rate: 20         # Downsampling rate: results show that this one can be up to 32 and still work, try it if you need a speedup
    downsample_prec: 0.5       # Downsampling precision: Indoors, lower values (~0.2) work better. Outdoors, higher values (~0.5) lead to less degeneracy.
    map_size: 1000000           # Maximum number of points in the map

    # Localizator - Degeneracy
    degeneracy_threshold: 5.           # Its magnitude depends on delta (see below), keeping it too high can cause blurry results
    print_degeneracy_values: false     # Print the degeneracy eigenvalues to guess what the threshold must be for you

    # Delta refinement
    # Choose a set of times and field of view sizes (deltas) for the initialization.
    # The delta (t2 - t1) that will be used through the algorithm therefore is the last one in the 'deltas' vector
    # Tick the 'Localizator' box in RViz to see the initialization in action
    Initialization:
        # No initialization
        #times: []
